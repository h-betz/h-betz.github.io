					<p>As part of an intro to AI course at Rutgers, my final project consited of implementing 3 classification algorithms in a language of my choice. I decided to implement K-Nearest Neighbors, Perceptron, and Naive Bayes. The purpose was to study the effectiveness of various algorithms in classifying images. In this case our images were from MNIST dataset and a dataset of images of faces and non-faces.
