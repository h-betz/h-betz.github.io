					<p>An ongoing project of mine to help me keep better track of my spending habits. This is my first attempt at 
					a full stack web application. The tech stack involves a Django backend, jQuery being used on the frontend, and
					PostgreSQL as the datastore - all hosted on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance. Future plans involve implementing
					d3.js for visualization of expenses overtime, and implementing React on the frontend to create a smoother and more
						pleasant UI/UX. <a href="https://www.holeinmywallet.com/">https://www.holeinmywallet.com/</a></p>

					<p>My senior project at Rutgers involved using Spiking Neural Networks to model brain activity. I decided to model brain activity when it "hears" spoken letters of the English alphabet. Although not as successful as I would have liked, there is plenty of room for improvement in terms of tweaking the firing rate to fire more often in a given unit of time.<a href="https://github.com/h-betz/NeuralNetwork">https://github.com/h-betz/NeuralNetwork</a></p>

					<p>As part of an intro to AI course at Rutgers, my final project consited of implementing 3 classification algorithms in a language of my choice. I decided to implement K-Nearest Neighbors, Perceptron, and Naive Bayes. The purpose was to study the effectiveness of various algorithms in classifying images. In this case our images were from MNIST dataset and a dataset of images of faces and non-faces.
